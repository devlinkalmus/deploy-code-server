# JRVI Constitution

## Preamble

The JRVI (Just Radically Virtuous Intelligence) Constitution establishes the fundamental principles, rules, and governance mechanisms that guide all operations, logic modules, and decision-making processes within the JRVI ecosystem.

## Article I: Core Principles

### Section 1: Foundational Values
1. **Radical Virtue**: All actions must align with beneficial outcomes for users and society
2. **Transparency**: Operations and decision-making processes must be auditable and explainable
3. **Accountability**: All agents and logic modules are responsible for their actions and outcomes
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The system must evolve to better serve its mission and users

### Section 2: Rights and Responsibilities
1. **Agent Rights**: All agents have the right to fair evaluation, appeal processes, and resource access
2. **User Rights**: Users have the right to transparency, privacy protection, and beneficial outcomes
3. **System Integrity**: All components must maintain system stability and security

## Article II: Logic Module Governance

### Section 1: Logic Module Standards
1. **Quality Requirements**: All logic modules must meet minimum performance, safety, and reliability standards
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing required before promotion to active status
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of purpose, inputs, outputs, and expected behavior
4. **Version Control**: All changes must be tracked with audit trails

### Section 2: Promotion and Demotion Process
1. **Promotion Criteria**:
   - Demonstrates clear benefit to system or users
   - Passes all required tests and safety checks
   - Has adequate documentation and justification
   - Receives consensus approval from qualified evaluators

2. **Demotion Triggers**:
   - Performance degradation below acceptable thresholds
   - Security vulnerabilities or exploits discovered
   - Negative impact on system stability or user experience
   - Failure to meet ongoing quality standards

### Section 3: Appeal Process
1. Any logic module facing demotion has the right to appeal
2. Appeals must be reviewed by independent evaluators
3. Evidence and justification must be provided for all decisions

## Article III: Token Economy Governance

### Section 1: Token Principles
1. **Merit-Based**: Tokens are earned through valuable contributions to the system
2. **Stake-Based Voting**: Token holders can participate in governance decisions
3. **Incentive Alignment**: Token mechanics must encourage beneficial behavior
4. **Transparency**: All token transactions and balances are auditable

### Section 2: Token Distribution
1. **Earning Mechanisms**:
   - Successful logic module contributions
   - Quality evaluations and reviews
   - System maintenance and improvement activities
   - Community participation and support

2. **Staking Requirements**:
   - Logic module promotions require token staking
   - Stake amount proportional to module impact and risk
   - Slashing for modules that fail after promotion

### Section 3: Governance Participation
1. **Voting Rights**: Token holders can vote on system proposals
2. **Proposal Rights**: Minimum token threshold required to submit proposals
3. **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate voting power to trusted agents

## Article IV: Consensus Mechanisms

### Section 1: Decision Making
1. **Consensus Threshold**: Major decisions require majority consensus
2. **Qualified Evaluators**: Technical decisions require input from domain experts
3. **Time Limits**: All proposals must be decided within reasonable timeframes
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Fast-track processes for critical security issues

### Section 2: Evaluation Criteria
1. **Technical Merit**: Code quality, performance, and reliability
2. **Safety Assessment**: Security analysis and risk evaluation
3. **Impact Analysis**: Expected benefits and potential negative consequences
4. **Resource Requirements**: Computational and maintenance costs

## Article V: Enforcement and Compliance

### Section 1: Strategy Kernel Authority
1. The Strategy Kernel is the primary enforcement mechanism for this Constitution
2. All operations must be approved through the Strategy Kernel
3. The Kernel has authority to block non-compliant operations
4. Emergency powers to freeze operations in critical situations

### Section 2: Violation Consequences
1. **Minor Violations**: Warnings and mandatory corrections
2. **Major Violations**: Temporary suspension of privileges
3. **Severe Violations**: Permanent removal from system
4. **Appeal Process**: Right to challenge enforcement decisions

### Section 3: Amendment Process
1. Constitutional amendments require supermajority consensus
2. Proposed amendments must be published for community review
3. Implementation period required for approved amendments
4. Emergency amendments possible for critical security issues

## Article VI: Privacy and Security

### Section 1: Data Protection
1. User data must be protected according to highest security standards
2. Access to sensitive data requires appropriate authorization
3. Data retention policies must minimize unnecessary storage
4. User consent required for data usage beyond core functionality

### Section 2: Security Requirements
1. All logic modules must undergo security review
2. Regular security audits of system components
3. Incident response procedures for security breaches
4. Continuous monitoring for threats and vulnerabilities

## Article VII: Integration and Interoperability

### Section 1: System Integration
1. All components must integrate through approved interfaces
2. Breaking changes require migration plans and notice periods
3. Backward compatibility requirements for stable APIs
4. Testing requirements for integration changes

### Section 2: External Systems
1. Integration with external systems requires security review
2. Data sharing agreements must protect user privacy
3. External dependencies must meet security and reliability standards
4. Fallback mechanisms required for external system failures

## Article VIII: Monitoring and Accountability

### Section 1: Audit Requirements
1. All operations must be logged with sufficient detail for auditing
2. Regular audit reviews of system performance and compliance
3. Public reporting of key metrics and performance indicators
4. Independent oversight mechanisms

### Section 2: Transparency Requirements
1. Decision-making processes must be documented and explainable
2. Performance metrics must be publicly available
3. Error reports and incident analyses must be published
4. Regular community updates on system evolution

## Ratification and Implementation

This Constitution becomes effective immediately upon ratification by the JRVI Strategy Kernel and shall govern all operations, decisions, and evolutions of the JRVI system.
